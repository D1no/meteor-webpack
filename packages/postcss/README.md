# webpack:postcss by [The Reactive Stack](https://thereactivestack.com)
Meteor package to integrate PostCSS (.css) import with [Webpack](https://github.com/thereactivestack/meteor-webpack)

## Warning
The .css files in your Meteor project are automatically added to the page stylesheet. Make sure your file is named .import.css unless it is outside your project directory.

## Settings (webpack.json)
- `css.module`: Enable local CSS by default
- `postcss`: Array of postcss plugins to use. You can set options by using an array with the plugin name and the option object. Example: 

```json
{
  "postcss": [
    "postcss-import",
    ["autoprefixer", { "browser": "last 2 versions" }]
  ]
}
```

**Note: postcss-import is automatically optimized with Webpack**
